    Text: "My opinions no longer hold with that of the Status Quo. I no longer believe
      that The Rage was some bungled attempt by \xC9lan Vital  Pharmaceuticals to
      try and create a version two of their Regen Nanite.\r\n"
  - Time: 25
    Text: "The Regen Nanite was a clever little blighter but it was still just a tiny
      machine...a computer that worked at the molecular level to keep the human body
      in prime condition.\r\n"
  - Time: 38.5
    Text: "The Rage Nanite is not a machine at all. I truly believe it is a biological
      entity!\r\n"
  - Time: 46
    Text: "A creature with a will of its own and the ability to replicate at an alarming
      rate once introduced to the human bloodstream. \r\n"
  - Time: 55
    Text: "There is no way \xC9lan Vital or any other such company could create such
      a thing.\r\n"
  - Time: 62
    Text: "At extremely magnified levels the look of this creature is truly terrifying.
      They look like aggressive little insects, in-fact....we now refer to them around
      here as being Na-MITES instead of Nanites...ha....that was my idea.\r\n"

    Text: "Is it at least possible that the Rage Namite is of extra-terrestrial origin?\r\n"
  - Time: 90
    Text: "Something that came down on a stray fragment of rock...or may be...even
      sub-terrestrial?\r\n"
  - Time: 97.5
    Text: Let's face it, there is so much about the world beneath our feet and at
      the bottom of our deepest ocean trenches that we are yet to discover.
