    Text: "This is Dr Julia Pearson for the Center of Rage Research. I fear this will
      be my final log entry.\r\n"
  - Time: 7.5
    Text: "I'm showing early signs of infection and it's unlikely the extraction team
      will reach me in time.\r\n"
  - Time: 13
    Text: "All of my research notes are stored on my computer in my office on the
      upper floor of the hospital. It is vital that you get this information back
      to HQ!\r\n"
  - Time: 22
    Text: "I had to turn the power off to the building as the electrical activity
      was drawing the attention of the infected so you are going to need to restore
      power to the building before you can access my computer.\r\n"
  - Time: 31
    Text: This can be done from the keypad in the power control room in the hospital
      basement. The access code is 23021971

    Text: "A section of roof gave way on the upper floor a few days ago leading to
      constant incursions from the infected.\r\n"
  - Time: 52
    Text: Turning the power on again will definitely draw them in.
  - Time: 56
    Text: "I am the only one left here now. All those that were stationed here with
      me decided to exit through the sewer system after the roof gave way. I hope
      they find  somewhere safe to await rescue. \r\n"
  - Time: 66
    Text: I stayed behind in the hope I could brief you on my research personally...that
      isn't going to happen now.
  - Time: 72
    Text: Dr Julia Pearson signing off for the final time.
